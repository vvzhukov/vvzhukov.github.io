**Hello and thank you for checking out my portfolio!**
I have been developing iOS applications for the last _"\\(Calendar(identifier: .gregorian).dateComponents([.year], from: .now).year-2020)"_ years :) I had an honor to teach 'Ubiquotos computing' class together with [Dr. Ioannis Pavlidis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ioannis-t-pavlidis/) at the University of Houston. That was one of my favourite classes and a lot of my students share this opinion. Here you may see some highlights of my work including pet projects, assignments, prototypes and experiments. Code is available upon request, some projects are [publcially available](https://github.com/vvzhukov/COSC4355_public_files).

**Highlights** 
- UIKit / SwiftUI
- list/collection UI rendering
- API calls (including OpenAI integrations)
- files download and parsing
- external databases integration (core data, firebase, SQLite)
- credentials processing
- JSON/XML/Protobuf
- accessibility
- iWatch  

**Other relevant skills**
- Got some experience in web-development
- Figma, Sketch, ColorHunt, Adobe Photoshop and Vegas Pro
